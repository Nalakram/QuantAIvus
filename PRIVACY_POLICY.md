Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 5, 2025 This Privacy Policy describes how the MarketMind application ("MarketMind", "we", "us", or "our") handles data. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about our practices. In short: MarketMind does not collect or process any personal data about users. The application uses only financial data from public sources or the Interactive Brokers API to function, and we ensure all data handling aligns with relevant privacy regulations.
Data Collection
No Personal Data Collected: MarketMind does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or personal data from users. We do not ask for your name, email, address, or any other contact information. The application does not involve user accounts or profile creation.
Financial Data Only: The only data MarketMind accesses are financial data needed for stock price prediction and analysis. This includes publicly available financial information (e.g. market prices, financial statements, economic indicators) and data retrieved via third-party APIs such as the Interactive Brokers (IB) API. All such data pertains to markets and companies, not to individual personal information.
User-Provided API Credentials: If you choose to connect MarketMind to external data sources (like your Interactive Brokers account), you may need to provide API keys or credentials. These credentials are used solely to establish a connection to the data provider and are not sent to us or any other third party. MarketMind does not transmit or store your credentials beyond your local environment.
No Tracking or Analytics: MarketMind does not use any tracking tools or analytics services. We do not collect usage statistics, telemetry data, or any information about how you use the application. There are no cookies, web beacons, or fingerprinting technologies in use. Your activity within the app remains private to you.
No Cookies or Browser Data: MarketMind is a desktop application (with Python/C++/Java components) and not a web service, so it does not use cookies or collect browser-based data. There is no web tracking of users.
Data Usage
Purpose of Data Use: Any financial data obtained by MarketMind is used only to perform the application's core functions, such as training models, making stock price predictions, and displaying analysis results to the user. We use the data you retrieve (market quotes, historical prices, news text, etc.) strictly for your own use within the application interface.
Local Processing: All data processing happens locally on your machine. MarketMind analyzes and combines the financial data to generate predictions and insights. This processing does not involve sending your data to any server or cloud service for computation.
No Secondary Use: We do not use data for any secondary purposes like marketing, advertising, or user profiling. Since no personal data is collected, there is no profiling of individual users. Financial data is not used to infer anything about you; it's only used in aggregate to feed the prediction models.
Public and Authorized Data Sources: The data sources MarketMind uses are either publicly accessible or explicitly authorized by you (such as through your IB API access). This means all data used is obtained lawfully and with permission. We do not scrape or collect data from sources that violate any terms of service.
Transparency: If in the future MarketMind introduces new data inputs or features, we will update this Privacy Policy to explain what data is involved and how it is used. Our commitment is that we will never introduce personal data collection without proper notice and consent.
Data Storage
Local Storage: All data used by MarketMind is stored on your local machine by default. For example, downloaded market data, cached financial information, model files, and any outputs or logs are saved to local storage (e.g., your computer’s hard drive or other local directory). We (the developers) have no access to this data; it remains under your control on your device.
Unencrypted Data: Currently, data stored by the application is not encrypted by MarketMind. Files and databases created by the app are in plaintext or their native formats. This means that anyone with access to your device or storage could potentially read the data. Please ensure your device is secure (e.g., use disk encryption or password protection at the OS level) to protect any sensitive financial data you retrieve.
Future Cloud Storage Option: In the future, MarketMind may offer an option to store data on a cloud drive or sync data through a cloud service (for example, to back up your models or datasets). If and when such features are implemented, we will update this policy. Any cloud storage integration will be designed with privacy and security in mind. At that time, we will consider adding encryption for stored data or leveraging the cloud provider’s security features to protect your information.
User Control: You have full control over the data stored by MarketMind. You can delete or modify the local files and data caches at any time. Because the data is stored locally, removing the application or its data from your device will eliminate the information completely from our side (since we never had a copy).
No Remote Databases: MarketMind does not send your data to a company server or remote database for storage. There is no centralized server collecting or holding your information. All storage is on the client-side (your side).
Data Sharing
No Third-Party Sharing: We do not share any data from MarketMind with third parties. Since we do not collect personal data, there is nothing to share about you. We do not sell, rent, or trade any data (personal or financial) to anyone.
No External Uploads: The application does not upload your data to any external service or developer-controlled server. The only network communications the application makes are to fetch data that you request (e.g., getting stock prices from the IB API or other public data APIs). MarketMind will not send your data elsewhere.
Interactive Brokers and External APIs: When MarketMind retrieves data from third-party APIs like Interactive Brokers, those requests may inherently communicate with that provider (for example, sending your account ID or a query to IB to get the data). This is strictly limited to the purpose of fetching the data you asked for. MarketMind does not provide any unnecessary information to these providers – only the minimum required to fulfill your data request. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Yahoo Finance) for details on how they handle data on their end. Importantly, MarketMind itself does not receive or store any personal data from these services about you.
Open Source Transparency: Being an open-source project (with publicly reviewable code), MarketMind’s behavior regarding data sharing is transparent. Anyone can inspect the code to verify that no data is sent to third parties or back to the developers. There are no hidden data transmissions.
Legal Compliance and Disclosures: In the extremely unlikely event that we are required by law to disclose data (for example, by a court order), we would comply with applicable laws. However, since we do not collect or retain personal information, we typically would have nothing personal to disclose. We would only ever disclose data if legally compelled and after verifying the request’s validity.
Security
Secure Connections: Whenever MarketMind communicates with external data sources (such as the IB API or other financial data services), it uses secure, encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS or the secure protocols provided by IB). This means that data in transit between your application and the data source is protected from eavesdropping. Your credentials and queries to data providers are transmitted securely.
Application Security: We take the security of the MarketMind application seriously. We strive to follow best practices in coding to avoid vulnerabilities. However, as an open-source (and multi-language) project, we encourage users and contributors to report any security issues found so they can be promptly addressed. Regular updates may be provided to improve security.
Data Security on Your Device: As noted, data stored by MarketMind on your device is not encrypted by us. The security of that data relies on your own measures (e.g., the security of your file system, use of encryption software, secure passwords). We recommend that you use appropriate safeguards on any device running MarketMind, especially if you store sensitive financial datasets. For example, using full-disk encryption or storing data in a secure folder can add protection.
No Warranty of Absolute Security: While we do not collect sensitive data and keep all operations local, it's important to understand that no software system can guarantee perfect security. Because MarketMind doesn’t centralize any data, the risk is minimized to your local environment. Nonetheless, we will continue to improve the application’s security features (such as considering encryption for local files in future versions) and keep users informed.
Privacy by Design: We have developed MarketMind with privacy principles in mind from the start. By not collecting personal data and minimizing external data transfers, we reduce risk. We will continue to ensure that new features abide by the principle of privacy by design and default.
User Rights
Even though MarketMind does not collect personal information, we are committed to respecting the privacy rights of users under laws like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), and other data protection regulations. We outline these rights for completeness and to affirm our alignment with them:
Right to Be Informed: You have the right to know what data we collect and how we use it. This Privacy Policy serves to inform you that we do not collect personal data, and to detail our data practices.
Right of Access & Data Portability: Under GDPR, you can request a copy of personal data a company holds about you (and CCPA gives a right to know what is collected). In our case, we hold no personal data about users of MarketMind. Any data used by the application (financial data) is stored on your own system. If you want to review or export data related to your use of MarketMind, you can directly access the files and outputs on your device.
Right to Rectification: This is the right to correct incorrect personal data. Since we do not maintain any user records or personal data, there is nothing to rectify in our systems. Any data you input (such as configuration or API keys) can be changed by you at any time in the application settings or files.
Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): You may remove MarketMind and its associated data from your device at any time. Because we do not store anything on our side, uninstalling the application and deleting its local data will completely remove any information the application had stored. There is no need to request erasure from us since we never retain your personal information.
Right to Restrict or Object to Processing: You have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your personal data. MarketMind does not process personal data, so there is no personal data processing to restrict or object to. If you choose not to provide certain data (like deciding not to connect an API), the application will simply not have that data—there is no hidden processing of personal info.
Right to Withdraw Consent: Since we do not request consent for data use (as we don't use personal data), this is largely not applicable. If at any point the application asks for your consent (for example, if a future feature required optional data collection), you would have the right to withdraw that consent. In the current state, MarketMind operates without needing any personal data consent.
Right to Non-Discrimination: Under CCPA, users exercising their privacy rights should not be discriminated against. MarketMind does not differentiate between users in any way—every user has the same functionality without any need to provide personal information. We do not penalize or limit your use of the app based on any data-related requests or choices.
No Sale of Personal Data: We reiterate that we do not sell or monetize personal data (or any user data). This means you are automatically opted-out of any sale of information as per CCPA, simply because we have nothing to sell.
International Users: Regardless of your location or jurisdiction, MarketMind does not collect your personal data. We aim to comply with the privacy requirements globally by practicing data minimization and protection by default. If any jurisdiction-specific privacy law would require something of us, we assert that by not holding personal data, we inherently meet those requirements. If you have any concerns or questions specific to your region, please contact us.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as the MarketMind project evolves or laws change. When we make changes, we will modify the Last Updated date at the top of this document. For significant changes, we may also add a notice in the project repository (for example, in the README or release notes). We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data. Your continued use of MarketMind after any modifications to this Policy will signify your acceptance of the updated terms.
